The course has reached its enrollment cap.  If you were unable to enroll, but hope to join the class, please sign-up for the [CIS 121 Fall 2015 waitlist](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17whkGNwnCrwIey4vWwmbsPj34mDS5CBB968OFJHHXFI/viewform).
</div>

Course number:
: CIS 121---Fall 2015

Instructor:
: [Chris Callison-Burch](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/)

Teaching Assistants:
: [Course Staff](staff.html)

Discussion Forum:
: [Piazza](https://piazza.com/upenn/fall2015/cis121/)

Time and place:
: Lectures are Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10:30 in Towne 100

Prerequisites:
: [CIS 120](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis120/) and CIS 160

Textbook:
: The lectures and readings will closely follow [Algorithms by Sedgewick and Wayne, 4th edition](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X/).  The textbook has its own [web site](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) with some free materials, but you should also buy the full textbook.

Grading:
: The grading for the course will consist of 55% for homework assignments and the final project, 10% each for 2 midterm exams, 20% for the final, and 5% for recitation attendance. Recitation attendance is mandatory.

Late day policy:
: Each student has two free, no-strings-attached late days that they may use on programming and written homeworks. You need not let the course staff know; the course infrastructure tracks this automatically. Once your two late days are used, we will not accept your homework submission. One "day" here is anywhere between 1 second and 24 hours after the homework deadline, and a second "day" is between 24 hours and 48 hours after the homework deadline. Late written homeworks can be turned into Laura Fox in Levine 308. The final project does not have the same late policy; it has its own late policy, which will be announced with its release.

## The CIS 121 Collaboration Policy

### Written homeworks

#### You are allowed to...
-   Discuss solutions to these problems in groups of three,
    *documenting* who you discussed with at the top of your
    assignment.
-   Ask anyone for LaTeX help (for instance, "How do I center a stack of
    equations?").

#### You are **not** allowed to...
-   Write up the solutions together. You must do that by yourself.

### Programming homeworks

#### You are allowed to...
-   Discuss low-level issues, e.g., the meaning of Java constructs, how
    to use the computing environment.
-   Discuss high-level questions such as what the instructor/lab TA
    said, the content of the textbook or other general resources.

#### You **not** allowed to...
-   Discuss issues directly pertaining to the homework questions or
    their solutions.
-   See another students homework solutions, or
-   Show your solutions to another student
    -   This includes asking a classmate to debug your code and agreeing
        to debug a classmate’s code. If you do this during office hours,
        know that the TAs are *required* to report your names to the
        instructor.
-   Share any code except the code that is being made available by us on
    the course website to be used specifically with your solutions
    -   Occasionally, a *small* snippet of code *from the textbook* may help
        your work. You can use such a snippet *with attribution*, i.e.,
        provided you add a comment in which you make clear you copied it
        from the textbook.
    -   You can NOT use snippets of code from the Internet (e.g.,
        StackOverflow.com and similar).
-   Post code on, or use code from, public fora (e.g., GitHub,
    StackOverflow)
-   Look at other people’s information
    -   If you find a terminal on which somebody else has logged in and
        forgot to log out, you *must* log them out
    -   When somebody else is typing a password in front of you *must*
        look out the window, or at your shoes, or at the picture of Brad
        Pitt or Angelina Jolie that you carry on your keychain.
-   Use any code downloaded from the Internet or sent to you by email,
    Facebook, text, Twitter, or even scribbled notes passed from hand to
    hand :)
-   Share the material that we post for this course with anybody who is
    not a registered student in this course or a staff member.
    -   If you find any such material already posted somewhere else you
        *must* inform the course instructor immediately. Same if you are
        contacted by people who offer to solve your homework for money,
        or who knows what else. Use your common sense and ask any member
        of the staff if you are not sure about a resource you are
        considering.

Any violation of this policy will be dealt with severely.
